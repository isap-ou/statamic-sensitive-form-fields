## Release Notes Format

You can use the following custom Markdown tags in release notes:

- `[new]` shows a **New** badge
- `[fix]` shows a **Fixed** badge

## Versioning and Tags

Use Semantic Versioning for all releases (for example, `1.0.0`).

Create tags **without** the `v` prefix:

- `1.0.0` (correct)
- `v1.0.0` (avoid)
